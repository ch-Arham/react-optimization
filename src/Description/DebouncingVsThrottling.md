Debouncing and throttling are both techniques used to control the frequency of function invocations, but they differ in how they handle the timing of execution. Here are the key differences between debouncing and throttling:

1. Timing of Execution:
   - Debouncing: Debouncing ensures that a function is executed only after a certain period of inactivity. It delays the function execution until a pause in the events occurs. If the events continue to occur within the specified delay, the function execution is reset and delayed again.
   - Throttling: Throttling ensures that a function is executed at a regular interval, limiting the rate of execution. It allows the function to be invoked once within a specific time interval, regardless of how frequently the events occur. If the events continue to occur within the interval, the function execution is skipped until the next interval.

2. Function Invocation:
   - Debouncing: Debouncing typically triggers the function execution once, either immediately after the specified delay of inactivity or after the user has finished performing a specific action. It ensures that the function is called only once during a particular timeframe, even if the events occur multiple times within that timeframe.
   - Throttling: Throttling triggers the function execution at a regular interval. It allows the function to be invoked periodically, ensuring a steady rate of execution. The function is called regularly based on the specified time interval, regardless of how frequently the events occur within that interval.

3. Use Cases:
   - Debouncing: Debouncing is useful when you want to wait for a pause in events before performing a particular action. It is commonly used in scenarios such as handling user inputs, autocomplete search, or window resize events, where you want to delay the action until the user has finished interacting or a pause has occurred.
   - Throttling: Throttling is useful when you want to limit the rate of function execution to prevent excessive invocations. It is commonly used in scenarios such as scroll event handling, preventing rapid button clicks, or rate-limited API requests, where you want to control the frequency of function calls to optimize performance or avoid overwhelming resources.

In summary, debouncing delays the function execution until a pause in events occurs, while throttling limits the rate of function execution to a steady interval. Both techniques have their own use cases and can be applied in different scenarios to optimize performance and control the frequency of function invocations.
