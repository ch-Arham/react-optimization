Debouncing in React is a technique used to control the frequency at which a function is executed, particularly in response to frequent events such as user inputs or window resize events. It ensures that the function is only called once after a specified delay of inactivity, even if the event is triggered multiple times within that timeframe.

Debouncing is useful in scenarios where you want to delay the execution of a function until the user has finished performing a particular action. For example, in an autocomplete search input, you might want to wait for the user to finish typing before making an API request to fetch search results.

By debouncing the function, you can prevent unnecessary and frequent calls, reducing the workload and optimizing performance.
